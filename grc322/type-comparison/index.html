        <h1>Sabon vs. Times New Roman </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Times New Roman</h3>
             <p>Times New Roman was created by British typographer Stanley Morison and <span>The Times of London</span> advertising designer Victor Lardent 
				in England in 1931. Stanley Morison and the Monotype Corporation were commissioned by <span>The Times of London</span> to create the new typeface 
				after Stanley Morison complained about <span>The Times</span> “being badly printed and typographically behind the times.” Stanley Morison 
				supervised the new design and Victor Lardent drew it. They used the typeface Plantin as a base and revised it to have the better 
				legibility and economy of space needed by newspapers. A larger x-height gave way to narrower letters, meaning that more characters 
				could fit on each line without sacrificing readability. It is also a somewhat condensed font, so to make it more legible, Morison 
				increased the contrast of thicker and thinner lines to make each character stand out from one another. The typeface family includes 
				12 different variations. It was the first time a newspaper had designed its own typeface. Times New Roman was debuted by <span>The Times of London</span> 
				in October 1932 and was well received by the public. The name comes from the previous font used by <span>The Times</span>, called Times 
				Old Roman. Times New Roman became very popular around the world due to its readability and versatility. Originally, Times New Roman 
				was primarily used for newspapers, books, periodicals, annual reports, and brochures, but later surged in usage within computer operating 
				systems and productivity software. It became a standard font on most computers and digital printers and is now used in many office and 
				academic settings.</p>
             
			 <h3>Sabon</h3>

             <p>Sabon is a serif font that was designed by German calligrapher Jan Tschichold in Switzerland in 1964. He was asked by German 
				typesetters to create a typeface that uses the same design for three main metal type technologies of the time: lead type for hand setting, 
				linecasting on Linotype machines, and typewriter-like machines. The type was produced by the D. Stempel AG, Linotype, and Monotype foundries 
				all working together to ensure the typeface was the same across all applications. Tschichold was a pioneer in modern and functional typefaces 
				that were focused more on legibility rather than personal taste of style. Sabon is meant to be a new version of Garamond and it includes 
				Roman, Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic variations. With a large x-height, and low contrast of strokes, the type was able to be read easily 
				and be set using any machine of the time period. Consistent spacing between letters lessened the workload when typesetting and standardized 
				the type behavior between typesetting methods. The typeface is named after French type designer Claude Garamond’s apprentice, Jakob Sabon, 
				and is loosely based on 16th-century designs from Sabon’s foundry. The Sabon typeface is frequently used in religious texts, books, and 
				magazines.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/o_comp.jpg"

					contrast, as well as leaning slightly to the right. </figcaption>

					 alt="Sabon used for Hamburg Airport Singnage.">
				<figcaption>Main locations like terminals or gates are written in a sans-serif typeface, but secondary locations 
					like restaurants and conference centers are written in Sabon, as seen in the image. Sabon allows for easy readability of the wayfinding 
					signs in a potentially stressful environment.</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/garamond_history_book.jpeg"
					 alt="Garamond History Book.">
				<figcaption>Sabon is frequently used in large blocks of text, like those found in books, because of its large x-height 
					and low contrast strokes. This handset book uses Sabon for this reason.</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/stanford_logo.jpeg"
					 alt="Stanford Graduate School of Business logo.">
