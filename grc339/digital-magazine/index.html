                                <p>
                                    When it comes to baking cookies, cakes and even pastries, the creamy goodness of butter provides a rich flavor that’s tough to beat. (That’s precisely why the team at The Perfect Cookie uses butter to test most recipes.) But when the munchies come calling, and the butter dish is empty, consider these common butter substitutes.

                                <p>
                                    This simple lemon butter cookie recipe is made from only a handful of ingredients. That means for the flavor to really shine, it's especially important to use fresh lemon juice and high-quality butter (European-style is great here). You'll be using the lemon rind, too, so choose unwaxed lemons if you have the option. When zesting the lemons, take care to only shave off the outer yellow layer, leaving the white pith behind.

                                <p>
                                    In America, a cookie is described as a thin, sweet, usually small cake.  By definition, a cookie can be any of a variety of hand-held, flour-based sweet cakes, either crisp or soft.  Each country has its own word for “cookie.”  We know as cookies are called biscuits in England and Australia, in Spain they’re galletas.  Germans call them keks or Plzchen for Christmas cookies, and in Italy there are several names to identify various forms of cookies including amaretti and biscotti, and so on.
