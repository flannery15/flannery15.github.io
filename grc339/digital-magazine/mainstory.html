                                Hands down, the most common request I get is, “What can I use as egg substitutes for baking?” I get that 
                                question on a daily basis now, so much so that it made me rethink if I catering to this audience enough. 
                                I try to make my baking and recipes accessible to everyone, but because there has been such a demand for 
                                vegetarian baking, egg substitutes for baking, and egg-free recipes I want to give you the tools and information 
                                you need so you can bake happily without eggs and still get Big & Bold results.

                            <p>Sometimes it’s as simple as running out of eggs and not being able to head to the store. But, other times, there’s a real need.
                                Many want to avoid eggs for a lot of reasons: health, culture/religion, dietary restrictions, etc. Although adding
                                eggs makes for a different end product, it does not mean that we cannot do without. There might be a change in taste
                                and texture, but for the most part, the end result is still pretty similar. Here is a list that comes in handy for me 
                                while I am making such a recipe.</p>

                            <p>When baking cakes or cupcakes, for each whole egg used you can substitute it with one of the following:
                                ½ a medium Banana mashed, ¼ cup (4 tablespoons) Applesauce, ¼ cup (4 tablespoons) Silken Tofu, ¼ cup (4 tablespoons) Buttermilk.</p>

                            </figure>
                
                            <p>Flax seeds, also known as linseeds, are small, brown seeds derived from the flax plant. When ground into a fine powder, they can 
                                be mixed with water to create a gel-like consistency that mimics the binding properties of eggs. Grind the flaxseed in a coffee 
                                grinder and mix it with water. Allow it to rest till it becomes gelatinous, then use.</p>

                            <p>Try Substituting Bananas In These Recipe. Tip: If you’re going to use bananas, make sure they’re ripe — in fact, the riper the better. We’re not talking all the way black or brown, here, but ripe enough where mashing is a breeze.
